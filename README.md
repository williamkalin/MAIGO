# MAIGO

Maigo is a modern looking online store which has functionality which includes. Browsing and inspecting certain clothing items aswell as adding to a cart.

### NOTE ABOUT PAGE PERFORMANCE!

Since the every single part of the website that can/needs to be hosted (MongoDB,React,Express) is hosted on starter free-to-host websites (heroku/netlify). Both loading time and the fetching from the Express API is slow due to throttling from these free services. ESPECIALLY I would like to note that you might have to refresh the page once or twice due to heroku putting processes to sleep if not acesses after a while.
